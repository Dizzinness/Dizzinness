- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m Mika Blades.
Iâ€™m currently studying programming on my own.
At the moment, Iâ€™m focused on learning Web Development with JavaScript and Python in parallel.
Iâ€™m open to learning and comments to technically enrich myself.
I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.Iâ€™m interested in learn programing...
